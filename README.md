# Neural-Voice-Cloning-with-Few-Samples
Implementation of the paper titled "Neural Voice Cloning with Few Samples" by Baidu [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06006)

A checkpoint for the encoder trained on 56k epochs with a loss of 0.0810 can be found in the checkpoints directory

The repository is only partially complete. https://github.com/SforAiDl/Neural-Voice-Cloning-With-Few-Samples describes how to train and generate voice samples using Speaker Adaptation approach. Link to generated voice samples can be found there as well.
All the future commits will happen on https://github.com/SforAiDl/Neural-Voice-Cloning-With-Few-Samples repository.
